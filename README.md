# Blogs Series By Rodrigo Crespo.

This is a series of technical articles on Software design and Best Practices.
I will explain concepts **agnostics to programing languages** such as **SOLID** Principles, **design patterns** and
**architecture patterns**.
All articles contain a theory part and practical example with installation steps.

## Design Patterns:
- [Repository pattern](https://github.com/rcrespodev/Blogs/blob/main/design/repository/README.md).

## Architecture Patterns:
- ~~[Value Object](https://github.com/rcrespodev/Blogs/architecture/value_object).~~ _Coming soon..._
- ~~[Event Sourcing](https://github.com/rcrespodev/Blogs/architecture/event_sourcing).~~_Coming soon..._
- ~~[CQRS](https://github.com/rcrespodev/Blogs/architecture/cqrs).~~ _Coming soon..._

## SOLID
- ~~[Open-Closed](https://github.com/rcrespodev/Blogs/solid/open_closed)~~. _Coming soon..._
- ~~[Liskov Substitution](https://github.com/rcrespodev/Blogs/solid/liskov)~~. _Coming soon..._
- ~~[Dependency Inversion Principle and Interface Segregation](https://github.com/rcrespodev/Blogs/solid/interfaces)~~._Coming soon..._
- ~~[Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/rcrespodev/Blogs/solid/single_responsability)~~._Coming soon..._

Disclaimer: In this series of articles I intend to give my opinion based on my theoretical knowledge and practical
experience. That said, it is known that in software development there is no single way of understanding or putting
things into practice.

Feel free to generate the issues that you think are necessary in each post to be able to debate among all and continue learning!
